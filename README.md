### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Project title: What made you happy today?
+ This project is conducted by Qingyang Zhong (qz2317)

+ Project summary: Here in this project, I used data called HappyDB, and conduct research about topic analysis, then get in to the question that whether nationality has something to do with the happy moment. And from the result I think nationality do makes a difference but not much.
